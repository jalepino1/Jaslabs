<h3 align="center">QR Inventory Tracking Web App</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This web app was developed to allow automated inventory tracking to replace a manual and slow process of using excel sheets and manual comparisons.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Developing an automated inventory management system leveraging Python with Django for the server-side logic with PostgreSQL for database management. 

Inventory tracking is done with an integrated barcode using the ScanApp API. A JavaScript function utilizes this API to process QR codes and barcodes. Django's URL routing, template language, and views allow real-time comparison between the QR data, and the data within the database.

Django's built-in authentication features allow permissive access to the web app, as well as CSRF tokens for cross site communication.

The Inventory Management system includes tables that tracks all data within the database in addition to the last time each specific item in the database was last checked. This is done using Django's built-in templates with HTML and Django template language, and CSS for styling. Additionally, forms were made using Django's built in forms and relation with the database.

This project utilizes AWS EC2 and RCS instances to cloud host the PostgreSQL database, as well as the Django web application. Domain and SSL certificate rights were acquired using Amazon LightSail, Route 53, and AWS Certificate Manager.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Benefits

Automate Manual Tasks: 
  - Barcode and RFID scanning can speed manual inventory checks, inventory searches and decrease labor cost.

Error Reduction: 
  - Using software reduces errors from manual entries and display other information using algorithms.

Greater Organization: 
  - Inventory Management Systems help create better organization structures. They allow categorization of different items within an inventory and track products simply and effectively.

Data Security: 
  - Inventory Management Systems allow users to restrict the access to their inventory. Permissions like this can help prevent data breaches and ensure confidentiality through means of encryption.
